// Abstraction - means to showcase only important things to user and hide other things
// For e.g. ATM Machine (Process is hide but Simple Interface is shown to user)
// Abstraction is done by 2 ways - 1) By using Abstract class 2) By interfaces

// abstract means concept, it is a thought and it is present there but can't be used directly
